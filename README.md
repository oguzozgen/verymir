verymir - It' s online U :) And Fancy Data Visualizations.

I believe data visualization has more power than normal text. it's better to use dynamic visuals, instead of linkedin style texts.

The plan is, gather all your data around the internet by their API's
and create recent activities, plans, projects, publisies as a profile
then generate fancy Visualizations from  your datas.
Visualizations will be selective from marketplace at some point.

First planned API's for datas:
Github,
medium,
stackoverflow,
?freecodecamp


It's core my own BaseT-... repositories.
Development based on Microservice Archtecture 

* Reactjs + Hooks .Net Core 2 on the front-end side
* VisJS , D3js for Data Visualizations
* Identity Server 4 with OAuth2 & OpenId Connect for Authentication&Auhorization
* .Net Core 2 For API first example

The project is still on the load see you soon...


.solution file will be created
